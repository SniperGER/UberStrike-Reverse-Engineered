# UberStrike Reverse Engineered
The source code of UberStrike, restored as faithfully as possible and ready to compile.

## Compiling
The source code should be ready to compile. You only need a copy of both `UnityEngine.dll` and `Photon3Unity3D.dll` from UberStrike in the `AssemblyReferences` folder.
The idea was to split the namespaces to as many separate libraries as possible for modularity.
